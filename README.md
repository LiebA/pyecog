# networkclassifer
Repositry to hold files for classifying network state in a given window before light pulses

## To do:
* As features are currently each 1d, write some visualisation code with features and their correct labels. 
	- a) scatterplot matrix 
	- b) projection onto two or three principal components
* K fold validation
* Plot results of validation
* Code to assess the importance of features
* Normalise things to unit 1
* Some bugs in the orginal ephys trace - remove the glitches!
* Work out type of normalisation wanted, currently z norm, might not be best? 
* Double check the features, or have an easy way to check them on small data set so can see the single value given at the end makes sense... This would be useful when introducing other features
