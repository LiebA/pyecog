Potential features:
vector strength of cross freq coulping 
Wavelet coefficients
stationarity of prev to light - diff to when dive into blocks?
coastline
PCs of AR coefs, over time many small stationary bins
PCs in general - will not work?!
The low freq components? - including the weird change ups m hines did, per sec?
Or sum of wavelets
Eigenvalues

Asses by having counter for x and just plotting? per one. For AR "fingerprint" can use subplots.


Preprocessing?
::20,
0 mean and std varience? z  norm?
in blocks of whole thing?
